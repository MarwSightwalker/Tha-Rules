# Tha-Rules
OwO What’s this?

This is a community project where I, Sightwalker, make an unknown game from nothing based on the rules added. These rules and its contents will be added by anyone who gives me $2 or more (can be via Bits or donation) or a Twitch sub. There’s no limit for adding rules, I want to see how ridiculous it gets.

Rules:
The player can move a character to the right, the left, forward and backward. ✅ Created by: Sightwalker
The player wins the game when it reaches the ending position.✅ Created by: Sightwalker
There is a power-up that lets you control the ending position for a set time. ✅ Created by: gustavrsh
There is an enemy character in “pear” (the fruit) format, it is extremely aggressive and has a lot of fur. Its name is “THE BIG BITCH” (“A CACHORRA” in Portuguese). It will lick the player character and inflict damage. ✅ Created by: queenmaaay
Player will have a weapon that will slow time for the enemy that it hits but it will have charges and if the player shoots the weapon with 0 charges it will slow the enemy but it will cause backslash so the player will have reverse control for some time. The player can pick up ammo that spawns on the ground to reload. Created by: MlekonCz
There is going to be a door in the game that you can pass through and if you do, it can change the way you look. ✅ Created by: andressalemon
The player character has moods that change its attack and defense mechanics based on which emotions he/her is feeling. The emotions change based on things that happen in the game. Created by: guivainberg
You can control a parallel character (with other inputs) that can be used to disturb the enemy, but that can’t win the game by itself. Created by: findifesta
Lolis will spawn randomly across the map and the player will have to dodge them to avoid being smashed. Created by: BAKAKAROTO
